**Sverchok parametric tools**  
version 0.2.7  
addon for: blender.org  
License: GPL3  
  
**Description**  
Sverchok is a powerful parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes. 
Mesh and geometry programming consists of combining basic elements such as:  

  - lists of Vectors representing coordinates (Sverchok vectors are zero based)
  - rotation angles 
  - matrices (user-friendly rotation-scale-location transformations)

Version 0.2.7 comes with more than 50 nodes to help create and manipulate geometry. Combinding these nodes will allow you to: 

  - do parametric constructions  
  - easily change parameters with sliders and formulas  
  - do cross sections  
  - calculate areas  
  - design materials  
  - use Vector fields  
  - even code your own custom nodes  
  - and more!  

**Installation**  
Install Sverchok as you would any blender addon.  
  
-  _Installation from Preferences_  
   User Preferences > Addons > install from file >
