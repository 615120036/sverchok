Sverchok parametric tools 0.2.7
addon for: blender.org
License: GPL3

Sverchok is a powerful parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes. 

Mesh and geometry programming consists of basic elements such as:
- lists of Vectors representing coordinates (Sverchok vectors are always base zero)
- rotation angles 
- matrices (user-friendly rotation-scale-location transformations)

Version 0.2.7 of Sverchok comes with more than 50 nodes to help create and manipulate geometry. Combinding these 
nodes can allow you to: 
- do parametric constructions
- calculate areas 
- design materials
- easily change parameters with sliders and formulas
- use Vector fields, 
- cross sections
- ..etc.

Install as blender addon, ctrl+alt+U => addons => install from file => choose zip-archive => activate flag => 
=> open node area in window (change window area type)
