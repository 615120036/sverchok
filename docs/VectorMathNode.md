## Vector Math Node

This is a versatile nodes. You can perform 1 operation on 1000's of list-elements, or perform operations pairwise on two lists of 1000's of elements, even if they are nested. It is therefore what we call a _Vectorized_ node, for an elaborate explanation of what this means see this [introduction](). 

#### Input and Output   
The node expects correct input for the chosen operation (called mode), but it will fail gracefully with a message in the console if the input is not right for the selected mode.   

Some modes accept a Vector (U) and a Scalar (S), while other accepts two Vectors (U, V). Some modes will output a Scalar (out), others with output a Vector (W). 

#### Modes
Most operations are self explanatory, but in case they aren't then here is a quick overview:
