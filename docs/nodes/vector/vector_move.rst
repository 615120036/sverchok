Vector Move
===========

Functionality
-------------

**equivalent to a Translate Transform**

Moves incoming sets of Vertice Lists by a *Vector*. The Vector is bound to a multiplier (Scalar) which amplifies all components of the Vector. The resulting Vector is added to the locations of the incoming Vertices. 

You might use this to translate the center of an object away or towards from [0,0,0] in order to apply other transforms like Rotation and Scale.
