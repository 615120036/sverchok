Recalculate Normals
===================

*This node testing is in progress, so it can be found under Beta menu*

Functionality
-------------

This node recalculates normals of mesh faces, so that they all point either outside or inside. This is equivalent of Ctrl+N and Ctrl+Shift+N in the edit mode.
This node is useful mainly when other nodes create degenerated geometry, or when geometry was generated by low-level operations with vertex indicies. It can be also used to just turn all normals inside out or vice versa.

Inputs
------

This node has the following inputs:

- **Vertices**
- **Edges**
- **Polygons**
- **Mask**. List of boolean or integer flags. Zero or False means do not process face with corresponding index. If this input is not connected, then all faces will be processed.

Parameters
----------

This node has one parameter: **Inside** flag. The flag changes direction of normals to the opposite. By default, the flag is not set.

Outputs
-------

This node has the following outputs:

- **Vertices**. This is just copy of input vertices for convinience.
- **Edges**.
- **Polygons**.
