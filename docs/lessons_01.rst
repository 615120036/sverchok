Introduction to Visual programming with Sverchok
************************************************

You have installed the addon, if not then read **this**. The following Units will introduce no more than 10 node types per lesson. 


Unit 01 - 4 vectors
===================

**prerequisites**

You should have a general understanding of Vectors and Trigonometry, if not then work your way through related KhanAcademy content, they are fantastic and comprehensive. It is essential for meaningful use of Sverchok to have a grasp on these concepts, maybe not initially, but later you'll want to do cooler and complex stuff.

Lesson 01
---------

Nodes covered in this lesson: ``Math, Vector In, Float, Range Float, Viewer Draw``. 

Let's make a set of 4 vectors and combine them to make a plane.
