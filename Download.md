## Installation instructions

Downloading and installing for the first time? We have a handy guide to keep that process as painless as possible: [the read.me](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/#installation)

## Sverchok for Blender 2.8+

This is a moving target, the most up to date advice [can be found here](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues/2326)

Sverchok does require a working numpy package, and usually Blender ships with numpy in a working form, any issues should be addressed in that thread, otherwise please say something in that thread (preferably also show the error message if you get one)
